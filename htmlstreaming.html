  <h2>Funimation</h2>

 <p>
   <a href="https://www.funimation.com" target="_blank">Link to Funimation</a>
 <br>
Funimation is the second best cause it has semi decent anime shows on there .Plus the service is good it doesn't run slow and its never buffers.But the thing is that some of the shows that you want to watch doesn't have sub or dub one will always be english or japanese you can't choose if you want to change the language.Also they also have a website you can buy stuff off the stuff they have on there is good but the thing is you don't get a discount like crunchyroll but the merch they have is still good but it's to expensive.
 </p>
 <h3>Top 5 Shows on Funimation</h3>
 <ol>
   <li>Blood C</li>
   <li>Attack on Titan</li>
   <li>Steins Gate</li>
   <li>Darling and The Franxx</li>
   <li>Dragon Ball</li>
 </ol>

  <h2>CrunchyRoll</h2>

 <p>
   <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com" target="_blank">Link to CrunchyRoll</a>
 <br>
 Crunchyroll is the best place to watch Anime. I say this Cause it has more choice to watch.Plus it can let you choose if you want to listen to it on sub or dub unlike funimation.Plus you get discount from ordering stuff if you pay for crunchyroll stuff so you save money buying stuff off of them.So That's why I think they are the best app to watch anime on.
 </p>

   <li>Black Clover</li>
   <li>Naruto</li>
   <li>JuJutsu Kaisen</li>
